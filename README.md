The project itself is served by a ***Flask*** application and has a training accuracy of **98%** as well as a validation accuracy of **92%**.

Feel free to download the project and try the application.

In order to run the project you need to install **Tensorflow 2.2.0**, **Flask**, and other basic libraries like **Numpy**. I highly recommend to use conda environments.
